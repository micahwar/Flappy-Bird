# Flappy-Bird
Flappy Bird made from scratch in c++ using OpenGL.

This project has a couple minor bugs, such as, infrequently, a pipe is rendered with incorrect bounds, as a result of a problem with the renderer. Given that this was done to get more familiar with OpenGL, this has been disregarded and will be fixed in a follow-on project.
