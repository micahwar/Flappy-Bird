# Flappy-Bird
Flappy Bird made from scratch in c++ using OpenGL.

Please note that due to repository size limitiations on GitHub, the .vs folder could not be uploaded, so there may be some issues in cloning and running in Visual Studio on a different machine. If you are going to try anyway, make sure to place the repo in "C:\dev\Flappy Bird\"

This project has a couple minor bugs, such as, infrequently, a pipe is rendered with incorrect bounds, as a result of a problem with the renderer. Given that this was done to get more familiar with OpenGL, this has been disregarded and will be fixed in a follow-on project.
